	If you've heard it once, you've heard it a million times, the most important product in skincare is SPF!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	The sun can be so damaging to skin in many ways, sun damage can cause skin cancer, burns and ageing. You'd think anything described with those points would be something people avoid at all costs, but for some reason people flock to the sun, even lather oil on with no SPF to get a bit of a tan (ever heard of fake tan?). This coveted increase in melanin when you tan, is actually a sign of damaged skin, not something to be very proud of...
</p>
<p>
	Another surprising fact is that SPF isn't only needed when it's sunny! Yep, harmful UV rays are always present, even on cloudy days, so it is so important to begin incorporating SPF into your everyday routine, all year round.
</p>
<p>
	The common excuses for not wearing SPF is that people don't want to feel greasy or oily or sticky, well luckily the skincare world has created some amazing formulas that don't feel like that slimy suncream you're used to as a child!
</p>
<p>
	Here are some that may be right for you.
