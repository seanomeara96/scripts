<p>
	<em>Stylist Tip: To get more hold at the crown of your head,
backcomb the roots with your paddle brush and then smooth over the top layers.
Try using a brush here, as when you backcomb with a fine tooth comb, you will
more often than not end up with crazy knots and the effect can also look less
natural and harder to brush out too.
	</em>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>TEXTURE SPRAY</strong>
</p>
<p>
	To create the ultimate up-do your hair needs to be dripping
with texture, in order to add life and hold to your shape once you start
styling. Spritz all over your hair and apply evenly to the ends, massaging as
you go.
</p>

</p>
<p>
	<em>Stylist Tip: If your hair is already dry and you’re
literally running out the door with a minute or two to spare, spray your roots
with a dry shampoo which doubles up to give hair that extra oomph and soak any
oil around your scalp, which is fab. Team this with a spritz or two of texture
spray and finish your style using the next three products.
	</em>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>CURLS</strong>
</p>
<p>
	If your hair is of the naturally straight persuasion that
you’ll need an extra oomph injected by some curls just at the ends of your
hair! Don’t overdo the bounce as this look only requires a little shape and
lift to be visible when you pin it up.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Try</strong>: Sleep
in Rollers - Amy Childs' Rollers Perfect to use as needed or
leave in overnight to give the hair lift and bounce. These two packs of rollers

</p>
<p>
	<strong>BOBBY PINS</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Marilyn once said ‘Diamonds are a girl’s best friend’ but
obviously Marilyn had never attempted this up-do. Some carefully hidden bobby
pins will stand as a great ally in creating this look. Begin by sweeping back
the sides and pinning them in place, then slowly section off the hairs that
left and pin each piece artfully in place at the back of your head.
</p>
<p>
	<em>Stylist Tip: Don’t be too precious about random pieces
floating down around the hairline as this gives a more “effortless” and
“casual” feel which is what where aiming for. Go ahead and use a light hold
hairspray now to finish off if you wish.
	</em>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>HAIR SPRAY</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Using a heavy inflexible hair spray will undoubtedly
diminish the natural and effortless appearance of this hair style. We suggest
that you opt for a milder, soft-hold more flexible spray to keep your hair in
place without dulling its natural shine.
