  <strong>Congratulations – you’re having a baby!</strong> Our handy shopping
  checklist will help you figure out what to buy and when, during your
  pregnancy!
</p>
<h2>Nutrients</h2>
<p>
  First off…let’s start with giving you the essential nutrients needed during
  pregnancy.

</p>
<h2>New Pants or Belt Extender</h2>
<p>
  Your belly may not be visibly rounder in Trimester 1, but your pants may not
  be fitting as well, even just a few weeks in. A new pair of pants with a bit
  of Lycra stretch might round out your wardrobe perfectly.
</p>
<p>
  If you don’t want to start buying new clothes just yet, try a
  <a href="https://www.inhealth.ie/carriwell-belly-belt-extender/"
    ><strong>waistband extender</strong></a
  >
  which turns everyday pants and skirts into maternity wear!
</p>
<h2>Pregnancy Pillow (A Godsend!)</h2>
<p>
  Some pregnant women say their number one favourite purchase during pregnancy
  was their
  <a href="https://www.inhealth.ie/pregnancy-maternity/pregnancy-pillows/"
    ><strong>pregnancy pillow</strong></a
  >.
</p>
<p>
  The multi-award winning Dreamgenii Pregnancy Pillow as seen in the image above
  is recommended by 9/10 women. World renowned brand, Boppy also do a
  <a href="https://www.inhealth.ie/boppyr-pregnancy-wedge/"
    ><strong>pregnancy wedge</strong></a
  >
  to support the bump, if you are on a budget this is a great alternative to
  their custom fit
  <a
    href="https://www.inhealth.ie/boppyr-custom-fit-total-body-pregnancy-pillow/"
    ><strong>total body pillow </strong> </a
  >.
</p>
<h2>Skincare</h2>
<p>
  What do Kourtney Kardashian, Victoria Beckham, Jessica Alba and Sienna Miller
  have in common? They’re all fans of Mama Mio. With so many maternity skincare
  products on the market it’s safe to say that the most loved is Mama Mio –
  because it works! The
  <a href="https://www.inhealth.ie/mama-mio-tummy-rub-oil-for-stretch-marks/"
    ><strong>Tummy Rub Oil </strong></a
  >
  and
  <a href="https://www.inhealth.ie/mama-mio-tummy-rub-butter-for-stretch-marks/"
    ><strong>Tummy Rub Butter </strong></a
  >
  ensure your skin has the best fighting chance against stretch marks.
</p>
<h2>Fetal Doppler</h2>
<p>
  A portable fetal doppler is a fantastic device to use at home. It detects the
  fetal heart rate quickly from about 12-14 weeks through labour, and it’s safe
  and simple to use. From the Pocket Sized
  <a href="https://www.inhealth.ie/fetal-dopplers/"
    ><strong>Anglesounds Fetal Doppler </strong></a
  >
  to the hospital grade Fetal Doppler you are sure to find the right one for you
  in our
  <a href="https://www.inhealth.ie/fetal-dopplers/"
    ><strong>FetalDoppler</strong></a
  >
  section of the website.
</p>
<h2>Pregnancy Supports (Belts, bands & stockings)</h2>
<p>
  Pain during pregnancy can be frustrating and a good support belt or band is
  designed to support the lower back and abdomen during pregnancy. Visit our
  <a href="https://www.inhealth.ie/pregnancy-pillows-supports/"
    ><strong>PregnancySupports</strong></a
  >
  section to choose the right one for you. The Belly Bandit is the king of all
  bands and even supports SPD.
</p>
<p>
  Decreased core strength is common in the weeks following birth. Muscles and
  ligaments that were stretched and strained during pregnancy require time to
  heal. Weakness combined with the demanding job of caring for a newborn can be
  challenging and lead to injuries.
</p>
<p>
  Many women find that wearing a support postpartum provides additional support
  to the abdomen and lower back, decreasing discomfort.
</p>
<p>
  The
  <a
    href="https://www.inhealth.ie/scholl-light-legs-tights-black-compression-tights/"
    ><strong>SchollLight Legs Tights</strong></a
  >
  are new to the market and are compression tights that help boost circulation
  and give you perfectly shaped legs. The Medicare Open Toe
  <a
    href="https://www.inhealth.ie/compression-stockings-open-toe-suitable-for-maternity/"
    ><strong>MaternityCompression Stockings</strong></a
  >
  help promote circulation, reduce mild swelling and relieve tired aching legs –
  Hallelujah!
</p>
<h2>Labour Essentials</h2>
<p>
  As the final weeks close in it’s good to start getting prepared for your
  delivery with some labour essentials.
</p>
<p>
  If we can recommend one thing from our own experiences, it’s that a TENS
  Machine was a complete godsend – the burst function on a maternity Tens
  Machine will be your very best friend when those contractions start! Our Top
  Seller and best value is the Elle Tens but you can choose from our range to
  suit your needs in our
  <a href="https://www.inhealth.ie/tens-machines-1/">MaternityTENS Machines</a>
  section.
</p>
<p>
  Sitting comfortably becomes more of a challenge as pregnancy progresses. The
  use of a
  <a
    href="https://www.inhealth.ie/miracle-box-birthing-ball-total-guide-the-miracle-box/"
    ><strong>birthing ball </strong></a
  >
  during your pregnancy has shown that benefits including the maintenance of
  good posture, increasing blood flow to the uterus, placenta and growing baby,
  relieves pressure on the spin, perineum and thighs and will actually increase
  the pelvic diameter, encouraging your baby to descend in an optimal birthing
  position. In your final days you’ll just be bouncing on this…trust us!
</p>
<p>
  Some must-haves for your hospital bag include
  <a href="https://www.inhealth.ie/bv-maternity-pads-10-x-30cm-10s/"
    ><strong>BV Maternity Pads </strong>
  </a>
  aka greenpads and some good quality disposable <strong> </strong
  ><a href="https://www.inhealth.ie/ardo-day-night-disposable-breastpads-60pcs/"
    ><strong>Breast Pads</strong></a
  >
  for leakage protection. A
  <a href="https://www.inhealth.ie/pregnancy-maternity/pregnancy-pillows/"
    ><strong>Nursing Pillow </strong></a
  >
  to help you support your baby during feedings;
  <a href="https://www.inhealth.ie/lansinoh-lanolin-nipple-cream-40g/"
    >nipplecream</a
  >
  to soothe sore nipples. You may find long lists of hospital bag must-have’s
  online but you wont use half of it!
</p>
<p>
  And as we are big fans of all the amazing nurses out there, take our
  tip….bring the nurses a box of chocolates and leave them at the nurses station
  as you check in. It may sound silly, but being a maternity nurse is a huge
  commitment with each new mum that comes in, and it’s nice to recognize that
  with a little something, since you’ll be seeing a lot of each other over the
  next couple of days.
</p>
<p>Best of Luck from everyone at InHealth.ie</p>
